			<h4>On Grading in Higher Education</h4><br>
			<p>I am well-aware of the fact that I am not the first person, and especially not the first student, to find fault with the grading system.
			The extent of the issues it causes, however, were not fully clear to me until I began working as an Instructional Assistant at the University
			of Michigan. At this school, we often have large lecture sections and accompanying smaller weekly sections for discussion. These periods are 
			supposed to be opportunities for us to break down concepts and interact with content a little more deeply. Ask questions that we can't in a 
			200 person lecture. Ideally, this is the think-tank where we represent the idea of higher education; a general scholarly thirst for 
			knowledge and exploration.</p>
			<p>As my sentence structure clearly alluded to, this is unfortunately not the case at all. When students come to "discussion" section, very
			little is discussed outside of iMessage. As a student, I used to think this was due to a lack of imagination on the instructor's
			part. This can still very well be the case. Looking at it from an instructor's point of view, however, I now realize that that is not the only thing 
			playing a role. Students don't come to discuss, they come to get work done. If they do not come, it is to get work done
			somewhere else. They do not ask questions to learn and understand, but to get problem ten correct. As soon as the question is completed, the 
			thought often is too.</p>
			<p>Of course, these statements are not true for every individual. The degree to which they are, however, seriously call the efficacy
			of the current system into question. Grades distract students to the point that they are the dictating commanders of the education system, 
			as opposed to being an evaluation tool for improvement. This not only detracts from the learning process, but also from the general perception of 
			school. Many of my peers lament about how much they "hate" school, how miserable it makes them. This confuses me, as getting a higher education
			seems like a wonderful problem to have. For many, however, education is not the reason they are here. They are here to get a job afterwards.
			Thus, we see the need for grades. We find a need to distinguish between those that studied their craft to become a professional and those that
			just want to get paid more after four years of Hamm's Lite. As such, grades have become the currency of education.</p>
			<p>I do not write here with a solution to the woes currency that creates for human beings. I write instead to encourage a more perspective approach to
			grades for instructors and students alike. With a greater focus on the enjoyment of learning, I believe we can reshape the 
			education system for ourselves. Reducing such obsessive attentiveness to grades makes us smarter and happier individuals.</p>
			<p>The poor and the rich tend to view money in the same way; it will always go, but it will also always come back. In the meantime, there are much more 
			important things to put energy into.</p>
